# WASOTA - What Are the States Of The Art?

Welcome to the WASOTA project!

WASOTA is a web repository that encourages researchers to keep track of state-of-the-art measurements in a centralized way and search for the best runs given a domain and a specific measure, e.g. *NER* and *accuracy*. 

## Try our online DEMO ##
Do you have [MEX](http://mex.aksw.org/) files in RDF format to be published on the web?
Try out our [DEMO](http://cirola2000.cloudapp.net:3019/#/home) to add your experiments and compare your results with other experiment configurations.

## Deploy WASOTA yourself ##
As most node.js projects, after cloning the git project, you need to install the package using `npm install`.
