# WASOTA - What are the state-of-the-art for?

Welcome to the WASOTA project!

WASOTA is a web repository that encourages researches to keep "state-of-the-art" measures centralized, searching for the best runs based on a domain and specific measure, e.g.: "NER" and "accuracy". 

## Try our online DEMO ##
Do you have [MEX RDF](http://mex.aksw.org/) files to be published on the web?
Try out our [DEMO](http://cirola2000.cloudapp.net:3019/#/home) to add your experiments and compare your results with other experiment configurations.

## Deploy WASOTA yourself ##
As most node.js projects, after clonning the git project you need to install the package using `npm install`.
